            for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During
            the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers
            and public health officials are using Rt to assess the
            effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However,
            estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges,
            with critical implications for the interpretation of the course
            of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize
            these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic
            data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near
            real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and
            colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical
            estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods
            that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis,
            are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near
            real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective
            analyses of how individuals infected at different time points
            contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods
            derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the
            resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural
            assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all
            approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval
            and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from
            observations occurring long after the moment of transmission.
            Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as
            subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce
            bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other
            technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt

             evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and
             estimating the impact of changes in policy. Methods: We use case
             and death notification data to generate daily estimates of the
             time-varying reproduction number globally, regionally,
             nationally, and subnationally over a 12-week rolling window. Our
             modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for
             uncertainty in reporting delays, so that the reproduction number
             is estimated based on underlying latent infections. Results:
             Estimates of the reproduction number, trajectories of
             infections, and forecasts are displayed on a dedicated website
             as both maps and time series, and made available to download in
             tabular form. Conclusions: This decision-support tool can be
             used to assess changes in virus transmission both globally,
             regionally, nationally, and subnationally. This allows public
             health officials and policymakers to track the progress of the
             outbreak in near real-time using an epidemiologically valid
             measure. As well as providing regular updates on our website, we
             also provide an open source tool-set so that our approach can be
             used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential
             data-sets. We hope that our tool will be used to support
             decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19

            different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities
            between September 2020 and June 2021. This analysis reveals a
            series of subepidemics that peaked in early autumn 2020, followed
            by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage. The
            Alpha variant grew when other lineages declined during the second
            national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between
            November and December 2020. A third more stringent national
            lockdown suppressed the Alpha variant and eliminated nearly all
            other lineages in early 2021. Yet a series of variants (most of
            which contained the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and
            persisted at moderately increasing proportions. However, by
            accounting for sustained introductions, we found that the

            reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in England became
            increasingly heterogeneous during April and May 2021. This may
            have been attributable to the spread of the Delta SARS-CoV-2
            variant. This paper documents real-time analysis that aimed to
            investigate the association between changes in the proportion of
            positive cases that were S-gene positive, an indicator of the
            Delta variant against a background of the previously predominant
            Alpha variant, and the estimated time-varying Rt at the level of
            upper-tier local authorities (UTLA).MethodWe explored the
            relationship between the proportion of samples that were S-gene
            positive and the Rt of test-positive cases over time from the 23
            February 2021 to the 25 May 2021. Effective reproduction numbers
            were estimated using the EpiNow2 R package independently for each
            local authority using two different estimates of the generation
            time. We then fit a range of regression models to estimate a
            multiplicative relationship between S-gene positivity and weekly
            mean Rt estimate.ResultsWe found evidence of an association
            between increased mean Rt estimates and the proportion of S-gene
            positives across all models evaluated with the magnitude of the
            effect increasing as model flexibility was decreased. Models that
            adjusted for either national level or NHS region level
            time-varying residuals were found to fit the data better,
            suggesting potential unexplained confounding.ConclusionsOur
            results indicated that even after adjusting for time-varying
            residuals between NHS regions, S-gene positivity was associated
            with an increase in the effective reproduction number of
            COVID-19. These findings were robust across a range of models and
            generation time assumptions, though the specific effect size was
            variable depending on the assumptions used. The lower bound of
            the estimated effect indicated that the reproduction number of
            Delta was above 1 in almost all local authorities throughout the
            period of investigation.",

            to assess changes in transmission potential during an epidemic.
            While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can
            be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and
            potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt
            estimates to different data sources representing COVID-19 in
            England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track
            epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public
            data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths with
            confirmed COVID-19 in seven regions of England over March through
            August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved
            infections to each data source. We then compared differences in
            Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data
            over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for
            each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates
            varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on
            hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally
            synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test
            positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased
            representations of subpopulations in each data source. These
            included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in
            hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link
            between age and severity of the disease. We highlight that policy
            makers could better target interventions by considering the
            source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify
