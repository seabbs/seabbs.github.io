# Personal site

[![render-site](https://github.com/seabbs/seabbs.github.io/actions/workflows/render-site.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seabbs/seabbs.github.io/actions/workflows/render-site.yaml)

I use this site as a central resource for Sam related news, and to host blog posts.

It is made with [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) using inspiration and code from the [Distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io) and [Miles Mcbain's site](https://www.milesmcbain.com).
